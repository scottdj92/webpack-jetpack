# webpack-jetpack
An Electron application for building Webpack configurations.

## The Idea
Webpack is an incredibly modular bundler. There's several different ways to do the same thing, and there's a lot of inconsistency regarding which config will work for a project.

This Electron app is designed to get you started, not to replace hand-coding your own configuration. I think this will lower the barrier of entry of using Webpack.

### Planned Features
1. Package scraping
2. Configuration export/import
3. Support for languages other than Javascript
4. ???
